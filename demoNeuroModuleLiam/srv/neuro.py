# Writing a neural network in Python using the Keras library can be divided into several steps:
#
# Import the necessary modules and functions from the Keras library. To do this, run the following command in your
# program:
#
# import keras
# from keras import layers
#
# Definition of network architecture. In this step, we define the topology of the network, including the number of
# layers, the types of output and input operands for each layer, and the activation functions for each neurona. In
# addition, we also indicate linear or non-linear causality between input data and target values. Since this case
# uses a single layer recurrent neural network (RNN), we must keep in mind that each incoming element will be
# represented by a separate vector. This vector must be created by adding the previous result to the current input.
# This process is called gap filling. To create an RNN network, keep in mind that the last layer is hidden. It allows
# you to process information about the preceding pairs of elements in a sequence. To apply gap filling to this
# architecture, you need to add another input layer that receives information from the previous steps. You will also
# need to add a new block to store the memory state. Create a model object. To create a model object, you need to set
# two parameters: model configuration arguments and training. A configuration is a set of options that are used to
# connect a model to data. Training is a training method that is chosen for the best compromise between learning
# speed and quality. There are many different learning algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD),
# Minimax Gradient Descent (Momentum) or Adam. They differ in how they update model parameters during training.
# Conclusion and training. Once a model has been created, it can be used for training to find the best match between
# inputs and outputs. Learning can take place using any of the many existing learning methods such as SGD or
# Momentum. Data loading and differentiation. You can use the standard model selection mechanism to determine the
# parameter setting. However, if you want to manage this process manually, you can use selection and differentiation
# functions such as compile() and fit(), which are designed to manipulate and train models. Sample code for loading
# data from a CSV file:
#
# data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
# X_train = data['inputs']
# y_train = data['outputs']
#
# Sample code for diff:
#
# model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
#
# Model training. Note that in this example we have used a linear relationship as the output layer, so we are using a
# scatter matrix instead of an activation function. This makes the calculation list a direct product. Using this
# method, we get observations about how hardware operations can be used to analyze data sequences.
